## 4 Pillars of OOP contd.

### __repr__ method
- Special method, like __init__, which is ised to define a string representation for an object. 
- Particularly used for debugging and development because it can give detailed info about an object. 

### Composition of OOP
- Design principle where a class is composed of one or more objects from other classes. 
- An alternative to inheritance. It is often times more flexible and modular. 
- Avoids inheritance's pitfall: changes in base class can unintentionally affect the derived class, which may break their functionality. 
- Composition does not directly affect the composed class, as the class inherits from component classes through well-defined interfaces.
